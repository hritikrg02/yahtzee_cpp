# yahtzee_cpp
This project was created in order to help me understand the basics of C++ programming, in that I would esstenially translate between some of my older _yahtzee_ 
programs (written in languages I am more familiar with) and C++.

## Plans for the future
I may come back later to this project in order to add features, but for now, I am happy with it :D
